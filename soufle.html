        <li><p><b> Fold in egg whites: </b></p><p> In two additions, fold egg-white mixture into soufflé base: With a rubber spatula, gently cut down through center and lift up some base from bottom of bowl. Turning bowl, steadily continue to cut down and lift up base until just combined. </p></li>

    <p><b>The Best Dish for Baking Soufflé</b></p>
    <img src="souflefinalstep.jpg" alt="final" height="310" width="400">
    <p>Your soufflé will be its tallest, most camera-ready self when it cooks in a straight-sided baking dish with tall sides. Dishes with sloped sides don't allow a soufflé to rise evenly. </p>
    <p> You can make six individual soufflés using ramekins rather than one shareable dish. If you opt for individual ramekins for this recipe, follow the same steps to make the soufflé batter, but pull them from the oven 10 to 15 minutes earlier than the recipe notes. </p>
